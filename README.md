# HARKONNEN

A variant of the [Atreus62](https://github.com/profet23/atreus62), that's been stretched to accomdate a feather.
Another way to think about this is as a very large feather wing.

## Software

QMK works on it, will include a link here eventually.

## Building

### Parts

TODO

### Laser Cutting

The design files for laser cutting the plate / case are all contained here, you need to cut top.svg and middle.svg

### Wiring

The keyboard wiring r2.svg file shows how the keyboards matrix is contructed.
Some violence was done to it to make it use the minimum number of pins possible.

The pin map is available as an [online spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iDyUBJJbKarKhOK65EzkKA9Op6N0ExQvh2ANYo-jnFA/edit?usp=sharing), or as the harkonen wiring.xlsx file
